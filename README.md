### <a name="Description"></a>Description
Progressive Budget is a simple budgeting application that utilizes JavaScript, Node, Express, and IndexedDB to cache user's inputs in the event that they lose connection to the server. While not a super common problem, it is more a demonstration of what IndexedDB can do, and is definitely a convenient feature to have.
